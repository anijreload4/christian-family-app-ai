# Complete Implementation Guide: Christian Family App AI Integration

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for implementing AI features in your Christian family app using free models through OpenRouter and hosting on Netlify.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create OpenRouter Account
1. Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to your account settings and generate an API key
4. Save this key - you'll need it for all API calls

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `christian-family-app-ai`)
2. Clone it to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/christian-family-app-ai.git
   cd christian-family-app-ai

### Step 3: Initialize Project Structure
```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p functions utils
npm init -y
npm install axios dotenv cors express netlify-cli nodemon
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
APP_DOMAIN=https://yourchristianapp.com
```

Create a `.gitignore` file:
```
node_modules
.env
.DS_Store
```

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### Step 1: Create Model Selection Utility

Create a file at `utils/modelSelection.js`:

```javascript
// utils/modelSelection.js
// This module centralizes model selection logic

// Define models by capability
const MODELS = {
  // For complex reasoning and user assistance
  ASSISTANT: "google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free",
  
  // For Bible content and theological understanding
  BIBLE: "mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free",
  
  // For social features and content analysis
  SOCIAL: "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free",
  
  // Fallback model for any use case
  FALLBACK: "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free"
}
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial implementation of AI features"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

1. Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: Will be auto-detected

5. Configure environment variables:
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add the following:
     - OPENROUTER_API_KEY: your_api_key
     - APP_DOMAIN: your_app_domain

6. Deploy your site
7. Once deployed, note your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://your-app.netlify.app`)

### Step 4: Test Your Endpoints

Test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL:

```bash
# Test Bible study endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.netlify.app/api/bible-study \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"requestType":"dailyVerse","theme":"peace"}'
```

### Step 5: Integration with Your App

Update your mobile app with the API service file from Phase 4, making sure to use your actual Netlify URL.

## Implementation Tips

### Optimizing Performance

1. **Implement Proper Caching**
   - Cache common requests aggressively
   - Set appropriate TTL values based on content type
   - Consider using Redis for distributed caching if scaling up

2. **Batch Processing**
   - For predictable content (daily verses, weekly plans), pre-generate and cache
   - Consider a scheduled function to refresh cache during off-peak hours

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Implement graceful degradation when API limits are reached
   - Have static content ready as a backup

### Managing API Usage

1. **Request Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-user rate limiting for fairness
   - Add API usage tracking to monitor consumption

2. **Optimizing Prompts**
   - Keep prompts concise to minimize token usage
   - Structure output instructions clearly

3. **Model Selection Logic**
   - Use the most efficient model for each task type
   - Only use more powerful models when necessary

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Set up Monitoring**
   - Monitor API usage and response times
   - Set up alerts for API failures

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Stay current with new model releases
   - Update model selection logic as better free models become available

3. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Collect feedback on AI responses
   - Use feedback to improve prompts and model selection

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive, scalable foundation for AI features in your Christian family app, leveraging free AI models through OpenRouter and hosting on Netlify. The modular design allows for easy expansion and optimization as your app grows, while the caching strategy helps manage API usage efficiently.

By selectively using the best model for each task - Gemini for complex reasoning, Mistral for Bible content, and Llama for social features - you can provide high-quality AI experiences without incurring costs in your initial phase.
